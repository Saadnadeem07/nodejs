# Node.js Learning Repository 

This repository contains my practice and exploration while **learning/mastering Node.js**.  
I wrote code examples in VS Code and executed them to understand how Node.js works in depth.

## ðŸ“š Source of Learning
I followed the video course:  
**The Complete Node.js Bootcamp: From Beginner to Expert | Unlocking the Power of Server-Side JS**  
ðŸ”— [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsUL2bfKKLc&list=PLSDeUiTMfxW5vCie_cwsV6UPcZijHce8j&index=1&t=3226s)

- **1 - Modules Wrapper** â†’ Basics of how Node.js wraps code in modules.
- **2 - Modules** â†’ Understanding CommonJS module system (`require`, `exports`).
- **3 - ES6 Modules** â†’ Using modern `import/export` syntax.
- **4 - Path Modules** â†’ Working with file and directory paths in Node.js.
- **5 - FS Module**
  - **5.1 - Promise API** â†’ File operations using Promises/async-await.
  - **5.2 - Callback API** â†’ File operations using traditional callbacks.
  - **5.3 - Sync API** â†’ Blocking/synchronous file operations.
- **6 - OS Module** â†’ Gathering system information (CPU, memory, hostname, etc.).
- **7 - URL Module** â†’ Working with URLs and query parameters.
- **8-10 - HTTP Routing & Page Management** â†’ Creating servers, handling routing, serving pages.
- **11 - Events** â†’ Understanding EventEmitter and custom events.
- **12 - Streams** â†’ Reading/writing large files efficiently with streams.

## ðŸš€ Goal
This repo is my personal journey to get comfortable with Node.js fundamentals before moving into frameworks like **Express.js**.
